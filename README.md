# Film-Trailers

A small web application , where u can add all your favorite films for display. All the data from the frontend is saved in the cluster (movies collection in the Videos database).
I marked this project as complete on linkedin , however it's nowhere near done. I'm building it to gain experience , any feedback on this mini project will be greatly appreciated <3

The frontend is connected to the backend using Axios , passwords hashed from the backend using bcrypt. The backend is connected to the cluster which is saving data under the "Videos" database with each collection saving data appropriately. I'm learning how to implement JWT auth for 2fa while learning some advanced React concepts like Redux and Reducer.
